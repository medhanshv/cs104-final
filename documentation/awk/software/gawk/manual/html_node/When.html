<h3 class="section" id="When-to-Use-awk"><span>1.8 When to Use <code class="command">awk</code><a class="copiable-link" href="When.html#When-to-Use-awk"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-awk-uses-for-2"></a>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve seen some of what <code class="command">awk</code> can do,
you might wonder how <code class="command">awk</code> could be useful for you.  By using
utility programs, advanced patterns, field separators, arithmetic
statements, and other selection criteria, you can produce much more
complex output.  The <code class="command">awk</code> language is very useful for producing
reports from large amounts of raw data, such as summarizing information
from the output of other utility programs like <code class="command">ls</code>.
(See <a class="xref" href="More-Complex.html">A More Complex Example</a>.)
</p>
<p>Programs written with <code class="command">awk</code> are usually much smaller than they would
be in other languages.  This makes <code class="command">awk</code> programs easy to compose and
use.  Often, <code class="command">awk</code> programs can be quickly composed at your keyboard,
used once, and thrown away.  Because <code class="command">awk</code> programs are interpreted, you
can avoid the (usually lengthy) compilation part of the typical
edit-compile-test-debug cycle of software development.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Brian-Kernighan_0027s-awk"></a>
<p>Complex programs have been written in <code class="command">awk</code>, including a complete
retargetable assembler for
eight-bit microprocessors (see <a class="pxref" href="Glossary.html">Glossary</a>, for more information),
and a microcode assembler for a special-purpose Prolog
computer.
The original <code class="command">awk</code>&rsquo;s capabilities were strained by tasks
of such complexity, but modern versions are more capable.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-awk-programs-complex"></a>
<p>If you find yourself writing <code class="command">awk</code> scripts of more than, say,
a few hundred lines, you might consider using a different programming
language.  The shell is good at string and pattern matching; in addition,
it allows powerful use of the system utilities.  Python offers a nice
balance between high-level ease of programming and access to system
facilities.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF10" href="When.html#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a>
