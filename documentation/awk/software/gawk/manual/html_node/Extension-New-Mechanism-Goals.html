<h4 class="appendixsubsec" id="Goals-For-A-New-Mechanism"><span>C.5.2 Goals For A New Mechanism<a class="copiable-link" href="Extension-New-Mechanism-Goals.html#Goals-For-A-New-Mechanism"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Some goals for the new API were:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The API should be independent of <code class="command">gawk</code> internals.  Changes in
<code class="command">gawk</code> internals should not be visible to the writer of an
extension function.

</li><li>The API should provide <em class="emph">binary</em> compatibility across <code class="command">gawk</code>
releases as long as the API itself does not change.

</li><li>The API should enable extensions written in C or C++ to have roughly the
same &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; to <code class="command">awk</code>-level code as <code class="command">awk</code>
functions do. This means that extensions should have:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>The ability to access function parameters.

</li><li>The ability to turn an undefined parameter into an array (call by reference).

</li><li>The ability to create, access and update global variables.

</li><li>Easy access to all the elements of an array at once (&ldquo;array flattening&rdquo;)
in order to loop over all the element in an easy fashion for C code.

</li><li>The ability to create arrays (including <code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s true
arrays of arrays).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>Some additional important goals were:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The API should use only features in ISO C 90, so that extensions
can be written using the widest range of C and C++ compilers. The header
should include the appropriate &lsquo;<samp class="samp">#ifdef __cplusplus</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">extern &quot;C&quot;</samp>&rsquo;
magic so that a C++ compiler could be used.  (If using C++, the runtime
system has to be smart enough to call any constructors and destructors,
as <code class="command">gawk</code> is a C program. As of this writing, this has not been
tested.)

</li><li>The API mechanism should not require access to <code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s
symbols<a class="footnote" id="DOCF124" href="Extension-New-Mechanism-Goals.html#FOOT124"><sup>124</sup></a> by the compile-time or dynamic linker,
in order to enable creation of extensions that also work on MS-Windows.
</li></ul>

<p>During development, it became clear that there were other features
that should be available to extensions, which were also subsequently
provided:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Extensions should have the ability to hook into <code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s
I/O redirection mechanism.  In particular, the <code class="command">xgawk</code>
developers provided a so-called &ldquo;open hook&rdquo; to take over reading
records.  During development, this was generalized to allow
extensions to hook into input processing, output processing, and
two-way I/O.

</li><li>An extension should be able to provide a &ldquo;call back&rdquo; function
to perform cleanup actions when <code class="command">gawk</code> exits.

</li><li>An extension should be able to provide a version string so that
<code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s <samp class="option">--version</samp> option can provide information
about extensions as well.
</li></ul>

<p>The requirement to avoid access to <code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s symbols is, at first
glance, a difficult one to meet.
</p>
<p>One design, apparently used by Perl and Ruby and maybe others, would
be to make the mainline <code class="command">gawk</code> code into a library, with the
<code class="command">gawk</code> utility a small C <code class="code">main()</code> function linked against
the library.
</p>
<p>This seemed like the tail wagging the dog, complicating build and
installation and making a simple copy of the <code class="command">gawk</code> executable
from one system to another (or one place to another on the same
system!) into a chancy operation.
</p>
<p>Pat Rankin suggested the solution that was adopted.
See <a class="xref" href="Extension-Mechanism-Outline.html">How It Works at a High Level</a>, for the details.

<p>The <em class="dfn">symbols</em> are the variables and functions
defined inside <code class="command">gawk</code>.  Access to these symbols by code
external to <code class="command">gawk</code> loaded dynamically at runtime is
problematic on MS-Windows.</p>
