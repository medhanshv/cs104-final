<p>Some things don&rsquo;t change.  Thirteen years ago I wrote:
&ldquo;If you use AWK or want to learn how, then read this book.&rdquo;
True then, and still true today.
</p>
<p>Learning to use a programming language is about more than mastering the
syntax.  One needs to acquire an understanding of how to use the
features of the language to solve practical programming problems.
A focus of this book is many examples that show how to use AWK.
</p>
<p>Some things do change. Our computers are much faster and have more memory.
Consequently, speed and storage inefficiencies of a high-level language
matter less.  Prototyping in AWK and then rewriting in C for performance
reasons happens less, because more often the prototype is fast enough.
</p>
<p>Of course, there are computing operations that are best done in C or C++.
With <code class="command">gawk</code> 4.1 and later, you do not have to choose between writing
your program in AWK or in C/C++.  You can write most of your
program in AWK and the aspects that require C/C++ capabilities can be written
in C/C++, and then the pieces glued together when the <code class="command">gawk</code> module loads
the C/C++ module as a dynamic plug-in.
<a class="ref" href="Dynamic-Extensions.html">Writing Extensions for <code class="command">gawk</code></a>,
has all the
details, and, as expected, many examples to help you learn the ins and outs.
</p>
<p>I enjoy programming in AWK and had fun (re)reading this book.
I think you will too.
