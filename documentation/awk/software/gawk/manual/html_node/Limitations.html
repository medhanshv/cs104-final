<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-debugger-limitations"></a>
<p>We hope you find the <code class="command">gawk</code> debugger useful and enjoyable to work with,
but as with any program, especially in its early releases, it still has
some limitations.  A few that it&rsquo;s worth being aware of are:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>At this point, the debugger does not give a detailed explanation of
what you did wrong when you type in something it doesn&rsquo;t like. Rather, it just
responds &lsquo;<samp class="samp">syntax error</samp>&rsquo;.  When you do figure out what your mistake was,
though, you&rsquo;ll feel like a real guru.

</li><li>If you perused the dump of opcodes in <a class="ref" href="Miscellaneous-Debugger-Commands.html">Miscellaneous Commands</a>
(or if you are already familiar with <code class="command">gawk</code> internals),
you will realize that much of the internal manipulation of data
in <code class="command">gawk</code>, as in many interpreters, is done on a stack.
<code class="code">Op_push</code>, <code class="code">Op_pop</code>, and the like are the &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo; of
most <code class="command">gawk</code> code.

<p>Unfortunately, as of now, the <code class="command">gawk</code>
debugger does not allow you to examine the stack&rsquo;s contents.
That is, the intermediate results of expression evaluation are on the
stack, but cannot be printed.  Rather, only variables that are defined
in the program can be printed.  Of course, a workaround for
this is to use more explicit variables at the debugging stage and then
change back to obscure, perhaps more optimal code later.
</p>
</li><li>There is no way to look &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the process of compiling
regular expressions to see if you got it right.  As an <code class="command">awk</code>
programmer, you are expected to know the meaning of
<code class="code">/[^[:alnum:][:blank:]]/</code>.

</li><li>The <code class="command">gawk</code> debugger is designed to be used by running a program (with all its
parameters) on the command line, as described in <a class="ref" href="Debugger-Invocation.html">How to Start the Debugger</a>.
There is no way (as of now) to attach or &ldquo;break into&rdquo; a running program.
This seems reasonable for a language that is used mainly for quickly
executing, short programs.

</li><li>The <code class="command">gawk</code> debugger only accepts source code supplied with the <samp class="option">-f</samp> option.
If you have a shell script that provides an <code class="command">awk</code> program as a command
line parameter, and you need to use the debugger, you can write the script
to a temporary file, and use that as the program, with the <samp class="option">-f</samp> option. This
might look like this:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">cat &lt;&lt; \EOF &gt; /tmp/script.$$
...                                  <i class="i">Your program here</i>
EOF
gawk -D -f /tmp/script.$$
rm /tmp/script.$$
</pre></div>
</li></ul>
