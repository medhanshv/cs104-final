<p>The term <code class="command">awk</code> refers to a particular program as well as to the language you
use to tell this program what to do.  When we need to be careful, we call
the language &ldquo;the <code class="command">awk</code> language,&rdquo;
and the program &ldquo;the <code class="command">awk</code> utility.&rdquo;
This Web page explains
both how to write programs in the <code class="command">awk</code> language and how to
run the <code class="command">awk</code> utility.
The term &ldquo;<code class="command">awk</code> program&rdquo; refers to a program written by you in
the <code class="command">awk</code> programming language.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-gawk-awk-and-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-awk-gawk-and-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-POSIX-awk"></a>
<p>Primarily, this Web page explains the features of <code class="command">awk</code>
as defined in the POSIX standard.  It does so in the context of the
<code class="command">gawk</code> implementation.  While doing so, it also
attempts to describe important differences between <code class="command">gawk</code>
and other <code class="command">awk</code>
implementations.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF5" href="This-Manual.html#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>
Finally, it notes any <code class="command">gawk</code> features that are not in
the POSIX standard for <code class="command">awk</code>.
</p>
<p>This Web page has the difficult task of being both a tutorial and a reference.
If you are a novice, feel free to skip over details that seem too complex.
You should also ignore the many cross-references; they are for the
expert user and for the Info and
<a class="uref" href="../index.html">HTML</a>
versions of the Web page.
</p>
<p>There are sidebars
scattered throughout the Web page.
They add a more complete explanation of points that are relevant, but not likely
to be of interest on first reading.
All appear in the index, under the heading &ldquo;sidebar.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Most of the time, the examples use complete <code class="command">awk</code> programs.
Some of the more advanced sections show only the part of the <code class="command">awk</code>
program that illustrates the concept being described.
</p>
<p>Although this Web page is aimed principally at people who have not been
exposed
to <code class="command">awk</code>, there is a lot of information here that even the <code class="command">awk</code>
expert should find useful.  In particular, the description of POSIX
<code class="command">awk</code> and the example programs in
<a class="ref" href="Library-Functions.html">A Library of <code class="command">awk</code> Functions</a>, and
in
<a class="ref" href="Sample-Programs.html">Practical <code class="command">awk</code> Programs</a>,
should be of interest.
</p>
<p>This Web page is split into several parts, as follows:
</p>

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Part I describes the <code class="command">awk</code> language and the <code class="command">gawk</code> program in detail.
It starts with the basics, and continues through all of the features of <code class="command">awk</code>.
It contains the following chapters:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li><a class="ref" href="Getting-Started.html">Getting Started with <code class="command">awk</code></a>,
provides the essentials you need to know to begin using <code class="command">awk</code>.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Invoking-Gawk.html">Running <code class="command">awk</code> and <code class="command">gawk</code></a>,
describes how to run <code class="command">gawk</code>, the meaning of its
command-line options, and how it finds <code class="command">awk</code>
program source files.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Regexp.html">Regular Expressions</a>,
introduces regular expressions in general, and in particular the flavors
supported by POSIX <code class="command">awk</code> and <code class="command">gawk</code>.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Reading-Files.html">Reading Input Files</a>,
describes how <code class="command">awk</code> reads your data.
It introduces the concepts of records and fields, as well
as the <code class="code">getline</code> function.
I/O redirection is first described here.
Network I/O is also briefly introduced here.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Printing.html">Printing Output</a>,
describes how <code class="command">awk</code> programs can produce output with
<code class="code">print</code> and <code class="code">printf</code>.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Expressions.html">Expressions</a>,
describes expressions, which are the basic building blocks
for getting most things done in a program.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Patterns-and-Actions.html">Patterns, Actions, and Variables</a>,
describes how to write patterns for matching records, actions for
doing something when a record is matched, and the predefined variables
<code class="command">awk</code> and <code class="command">gawk</code> use.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Arrays.html">Arrays in <code class="command">awk</code></a>,
covers <code class="command">awk</code>&rsquo;s one-and-only data structure: the associative array.
Deleting array elements and whole arrays is described, as well as
sorting arrays in <code class="command">gawk</code>.  The chapter also describes how
<code class="command">gawk</code> provides arrays of arrays.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Functions.html">Functions</a>,
describes the built-in functions <code class="command">awk</code> and <code class="command">gawk</code> provide,
as well as how to define your own functions.  It also discusses how
<code class="command">gawk</code> lets you call functions indirectly.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Part II shows how to use <code class="command">awk</code> and <code class="command">gawk</code> for problem solving.
There is lots of code here for you to read and learn from.
This part contains the following chapters:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li><a class="ref" href="Library-Functions.html">A Library of <code class="command">awk</code> Functions</a>, provides a number of functions meant to
be used from main <code class="command">awk</code> programs.

</li><li><a class="ref" href="Sample-Programs.html">Practical <code class="command">awk</code> Programs</a>,
provides many sample <code class="command">awk</code> programs.
</li></ul>

<p>Reading these two chapters allows you to see <code class="command">awk</code>
solving real problems.
</p>
</li><li>Part III focuses on features specific to <code class="command">gawk</code>.
It contains the following chapters:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li><a class="ref" href="Advanced-Features.html">Advanced Features of <code class="command">gawk</code></a>,
