<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Programs rarely work correctly the first time.  Finding bugs
is called debugging, and a program that helps you find bugs is a
debugger.  <code class="command">gawk</code> has a built-in debugger that works very
similarly to the GNU Debugger, GDB.

</li><li>Debuggers let you step through your program one statement at a time,
examine and change variable and array values, and do a number of other
things that let you understand what your program is actually doing (as
opposed to what it is supposed to do).

</li><li>Like most debuggers, the <code class="command">gawk</code> debugger works in terms of stack
frames, and lets you set both breakpoints (stop at a point in the code)
and watchpoints (stop when a data value changes).

</li><li>The debugger command set is fairly complete, providing control over
breakpoints, execution, viewing and changing data, working with the stack,
getting information, and other tasks.

</li><li>If the GNU Readline library is available when <code class="command">gawk</code> is
compiled, it is used by the debugger to provide command-line history
and editing.

</li><li>Usually, the debugger does not affect the
program being debugged, but occasionally it can.
