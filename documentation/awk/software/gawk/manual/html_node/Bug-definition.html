<p>Before talking about reporting bugs, let&rsquo;s define what is a bug,
and what is not.
</p>
<p>A bug is:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>When <code class="command">gawk</code> behaves differently from what&rsquo;s described
in the POSIX standard, and that difference is not mentioned
in this Web page as being done on purpose.

</li><li>When <code class="command">gawk</code> behaves differently from what&rsquo;s described
in this Web page.

</li><li>When <code class="command">gawk</code> behaves differently from other <code class="command">awk</code>
implementations in particular circumstances, and that behavior cannot
be attributed to an additional feature in <code class="command">gawk</code>.

</li><li>Something that is obviously wrong, such as a core dump.

</li><li>When this Web page is unclear or ambiguous about a particular
feature&rsquo;s behavior.
</li></ul>

<p>The following things are <em class="emph">not</em> bugs, and should not be reported
to the bug mailing list.  You can ask about them on the &ldquo;help&rdquo; mailing
list (see <a class="pxref" href="Asking-for-help.html">Where To Send Non-bug Questions</a>), but don&rsquo;t be surprised if you get an
answer of the form &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how <code class="command">gawk</code> behaves and it isn&rsquo;t
going to change.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the list:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Missing features, for any definition of <em class="dfn">feature</em>. For example,
additional built-in arithmetic functions, or additional ways to split
fields or records, or anything else.

<p>The number of features that <code class="command">gawk</code> does <em class="emph">not</em> have is
by definition infinite.  It cannot be all things to all people.
In short, just because <code class="command">gawk</code> doesn&rsquo;t do what <em class="emph">you</em>
think it should, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bug.
</p>
</li><li>Behaviors that are defined by the POSIX standard and/or for historical
compatibility with Unix <code class="command">awk</code>.  Even if you happen to dislike
those behaviors, they&rsquo;re not going to change: changing them would
break millions of existing <code class="command">awk</code> programs.

</li><li>Behaviors that differ from how it&rsquo;s done in other languages. <code class="command">awk</code>
and <code class="command">gawk</code> stand on their own and do not have to follow the crowd.
This is particularly true when the requested behavior change would break
backwards compatibility.

<p>This applies also to differences in behavior between <code class="command">gawk</code>
and other language compilers and interpreters, such as wishes for more
detailed descriptions of what the problem is when a syntax error is
encountered.
</p>
</li><li>Documentation issues of the form &ldquo;the manual doesn&rsquo;t tell me how to
do XYZ.&rdquo;  The manual is not a cookbook to solve every little problem
you may have.  Its purpose is to teach you how to solve your problems
on your own.

</li><li>General questions and discussion about <code class="command">awk</code> programming or
why <code class="command">gawk</code> behaves the way it does. For that use the &ldquo;help&rdquo;
mailing list: see <a class="ref" href="Asking-for-help.html">Where To Send Non-bug Questions</a>.
</li></ul>

<p>For more information, see <a class="uref" href="http://www.skeeve.com/fork-my-code.html"><cite class="cite">Fork My Code, Please!&mdash;An Open Letter To Those of You Who Are Unhappy</cite></a>,

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-sidebar-A-Note-About-Fuzzers"></a>
<table class="cartouche" border="1"><tr><th>
A Note About Fuzzers</th></tr><tr><td>
<p>In recent years, people have been running &ldquo;fuzzers&rdquo; to generate
invalid <code class="command">awk</code> programs in order to find and report (so-called)
bugs in <code class="command">gawk</code>.
</p>
<p>In general, such reports are not of much practical use.  The programs
they create are not realistic and the bugs found are generally from
some kind of memory corruption that is fatal anyway.
</p>
<p>So, if you want to run a fuzzer against <code class="command">gawk</code> and report the
results, you may do so, but be aware that such reports don&rsquo;t carry the
same weight as reports of real bugs do.
