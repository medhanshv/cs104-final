<p>This section documents the design of the extension API,
including a discussion of some of the history and problems that needed
to be solved.
</p>
<p>The first version of extensions for <code class="command">gawk</code> was developed in
the mid-1990s and released with <code class="command">gawk</code> 3.1 in the late 1990s.
The basic mechanisms and design remained unchanged for close to 15 years,
until 2012.
</p>
<p>The old extension mechanism used data types and functions from
<code class="command">gawk</code> itself, with a &ldquo;clever hack&rdquo; to install extension
functions.
</p>
<p><code class="command">gawk</code> included some sample extensions, of which a few were
really useful.  However, it was clear from the outset that the extension
mechanism was bolted onto the side and was not really well thought out.
