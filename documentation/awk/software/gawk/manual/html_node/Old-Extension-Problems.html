<p>The old extension mechanism had several problems:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>It depended heavily upon <code class="command">gawk</code> internals.  Any time the
<code class="code">NODE</code> structure<a class="footnote" id="DOCF123" href="Old-Extension-Problems.html#FOOT123"><sup>123</sup></a> changed, an extension would have to be
recompiled. Furthermore, to really write extensions required understanding
something about <code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s internal functions.  There was some
documentation in this Web page, but it was quite minimal.

</li><li>Being able to call into <code class="command">gawk</code> from an extension required linker
facilities that are common on Unix-derived systems but that did
not work on MS-Windows systems; users wanting extensions on MS-Windows
had to statically link them into <code class="command">gawk</code>, even though MS-Windows supports
dynamic loading of shared objects.

</li><li>The API would change occasionally as <code class="command">gawk</code> changed; no compatibility
between versions was ever offered or planned for.
</li></ul>

<p>Despite the drawbacks, the <code class="command">xgawk</code> project developers forked
<code class="command">gawk</code> and developed several significant extensions. They also
enhanced <code class="command">gawk</code>&rsquo;s facilities relating to file inclusion and
shared object access.
</p>
<p>A new API was desired for a long time, but only in 2012 did the
<code class="command">gawk</code> maintainer and the <code class="command">xgawk</code> developers finally
start working on it together.  More information about the <code class="command">xgawk</code>
project is provided in <a class="ref" href="gawkextlib.html">The <code class="code">gawkextlib</code> Project</a>.
