<p>As an arbitrary design decision, extensions can read the values of
predefined variables and arrays (such as <code class="code">ARGV</code> and <code class="code">FS</code>), but cannot
change them, with the exception of <code class="code">PROCINFO</code>.
</p>
<p>The reason for this is to prevent an extension function from affecting
the flow of an <code class="command">awk</code> program outside its control.  While a real
<code class="command">awk</code> function can do what it likes, that is at the discretion
of the programmer.  An extension function should provide a service or
make a C API available for use within <code class="command">awk</code>, and not mess with
<code class="code">FS</code> or <code class="code">ARGC</code> and <code class="code">ARGV</code>.
</p>
<p>In addition, it becomes easy to start down a slippery slope. How
much access to <code class="command">gawk</code> facilities do extensions need?
Do they need <code class="code">getline</code>?  What about calling <code class="code">gsub()</code> or
compiling regular expressions?  What about calling into <code class="command">awk</code>
functions? (<em class="emph">That</em> would be messy.)
</p>
<p>In order to avoid these issues, the <code class="command">gawk</code> developers chose
to start with the simplest, most basic features that are still truly useful.
</p>
<p>Another decision is that although <code class="command">gawk</code> provides nice things like
MPFR, and arrays indexed internally by integers, these features are not
being brought out to the API in order to keep things simple and close to
traditional <code class="command">awk</code> semantics.  (In fact, arrays indexed internally
by integers are so transparent that they aren&rsquo;t even documented!)
</p>
<p>Additionally, all functions in the API check that their pointer
input parameters are not <code class="code">NULL</code>. If they are, they return an error.
(It is a good idea for extension code to verify that
pointers received from <code class="command">gawk</code> are not <code class="code">NULL</code>.
Such a thing should not happen, but the <code class="command">gawk</code> developers
are only human, and they have been known to occasionally make
mistakes.)
</p>
<p>With time, the API will undoubtedly evolve; the <code class="command">gawk</code> developers
expect this to be driven by user needs. For now, the current API seems
to provide a minimal yet powerful set of features for creating extensions.
